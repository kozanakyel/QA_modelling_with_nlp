119,129,abstraction is taking the problems in nature and trying to solve them with symbols. mathematics is a perfect way to abstract a problem. in engineering we have to come up with functions to solve problems. these functions are mathematical problems. therefore we always abstract our problems to solve them.,5,0.6654902696609497,0.36278772354125977,1,0.9384365246204657,0.6555715059408916
120,130,by making people think efficiently. for example there is a saying today abstraction path is tomorrow applied path which means the mathematical terms we are thinking about but can really comprehend today for example some kind of parades or some theories that are not prove yet will possibly be taught at high schools in the future. so its a cumulative thing. the abstraction we do today is going to help the engineers in the future.,4,0.5949968099594116,0.2524326741695404,0,0.9196312537441358,0.589020245957696

123,133,abstraction in mathematics helped in a good way to engineering better. also the way we think and the way see today is more beyond the space and time. it helped us to make sense things we can actually see in reality.,3,0.5836479663848877,0.705764651298523,1,0.9101830347525625,0.733198550811991
124,134,abstraction helps us to understand better axiom. today s abstract path is tomorrow s applied path. we understand better with formula. we need to start thinking and to do that we need to understand what we are supposed to think.,4,0.5561701059341431,0.24481134116649628,0,0.8246325136384436,0.541871320246361

128,138,"we can abstract some physical things to mathematical or other scientific models with abstraction. so, it can help us to understand and make better industrial or daily things. we can do engineering better thanks to abstraction.",3,0.6640761494636536,0.4146488904953003,1,0.8655426520344244,0.6480892306644593

130,140,"when we abstract something before we work on it, it is more easy to get over this problem and cheaper and time save because we first use imagination so the problem can be more solvable and our approach to problem become more fast.",1,0.5334562063217163,0.10476086288690567,0,0.8688341484776795,0.5023504058954339
131,141,they can think correctly of calculations . abstraction provided the abstract path become the applied path which we use today modern system. also there is a saying today s abstract path is tomorrow applied path. also algebra is big effect in the engineering . al kwharizmi is the father of algebra.,5,0.6258081197738647,0.25821155309677124,0,0.9110214348860262,0.5983470359188874
132,142,we can imagine the problem in our head by abstraction. for example we can take an easy real life problem and transfer it to in our head. by that way problem will get easier. this will make think and discuss better. we can do abstract solving.,5,0.5399537682533264,0.06748207658529282,0,0.8943230767710791,0.5005863072032328
